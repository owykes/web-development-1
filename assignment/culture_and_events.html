          Orkney, across its several islands, offers a dynamic mix of nature, culture, history and adventure. Each isle offers something different, with only 20 islands being inhabited out of 70. You can go with the known tides or carve your own path out against Orkney's versatile scenary.

          Most recently at Scapa Flow during both World Wars, and all the way back to being part of the Norwegian crown during the Viking era. Orkney has always played a key part in history. And if you think its only predictable inhabitants of the island that left their mark, did you know there's a beautiful Italian chapel in St Mary's? It was constructed by italian prisoners of war on the island, during the second world war. Just proving that you can't take anything about Orkney for granted.
