            As you can imagine life on Orkney can be removed from the many
            stresses of life, the folks here are community driven. Blending
            modern occupations with more traditonal ones you'd expect - fishing,
            farming and crafts. An equilibrium is acheived on the islands
            between the natural separation and the social traditions, festivals
            and storytelling past on from ancient visitors. There is a resilance
            and endurance of the people of Orkney that will never change, but
            also an adaptability that will always see the islands prosper
            socially and economically even further into the future.
